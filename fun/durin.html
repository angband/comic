<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - Durin's underwear</big><br> 
<br> 

<i>One adventurer found two randards named "of Durin" in single game...</i><br>
<br>
Durin is a rather famous dwarf... It's not surprising he had an extensive wardrobe filled to the brim
with powerful goodies. ;-)<br>

Home life must've been interesting for the hero-types.<br>
<br>
"Hey, hon... have you seen the Boxer Shorts of Durin?"<br>
"It's probably in The Dirty Laundry of The Dwarf-Lords with the Socks of Gorlim."<br>

The latest family sitcom! The 5000'-billies!<br>
<br>
Morgoth: Son, I'll whup you if you don't pick up yer Socks of Gorlim!<br>
Gothmog: Aww, Dad, they've only been there since I killed Ecthelion. Do I <i>really</i> have to pick them up?<br>
Morgoth: You just shet up yet saucy mouth, Gothy!<br>
Gothmog rolls eyes and picks up the Socks of Gorlim.<br>
Gothmog: By the way, can I go hang out with Shelob tonight?<br>
Morgoth: I'll not have you spending time with that slut! No descendant of mine will associate with Ungoliant's spawn!<br>
Gothmog: You say slut like it's a bad thing.<br>
Morgoth: You heerd me!<br>
Gothmog: Shucks Dad, we's in love. True Love!<br>
Morgoth: That's not how it's supposed to be. When I met yet mother, it was a tryst of convenience. She were pretty
for a demon, that Ulbandi. Almost as purty as Eiliniel. Sad I had to kill her. (looks wistful)<br>
Morgoth: But them spiders are bad news, all around. Especially them female ones. I shud know.<br>
Gothmog: But dad! I alriddy got a good movie theater and diner picked out! And they don't refund motel rooms.<br>
Morgoth: That's it! Yer gettin a whuppin, boy! Bend over!<br>
<br>
"Father Morgy fought the Valar, and dug down in the ground<br>
Cuz them Valar's rilly nasty and wuz chasin' him around<br>
He dug hisself a dungeon, he dug it way way down<br>
Ond now he lives thar at five thousand feet!"<br>

<br>

<b>You know you've got too much money when ..</b><br>
<br>
You start running away from Hydra (again)<br>
<br>
You carefully walk around the $ on the dungeon floor<br>
<br>
You program 'k-y' in as a macro.<br>
<br>
You buy everything in the black market just to see if they'll restock.<br>
<br>
You start reading the help files to see if there's some way to actually 
give money to the beggars in town..<br>
<br>
($3,000,000 and counting. 8>.)<br>

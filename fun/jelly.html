<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - The Day The Jelly Moved</big><br>
<br>

>> 3) The "does not deign to chase intruders" text has always amused me. Today,
as PC was resting near a <b>jelly</b> for mana to finish it off, it occured to me
that some "not deign" monsters might just decide it is time to start moving
when they are near dead. Either a few do it, or all have a very small chance<br>
<br>
> Or maybe they could just move very very rarely.<br>
<br>
&lt;dramatic voice&gt;It was a day like any others... or was it? For on this day,
something happened that only happens very, very rarely. So rarely, that no
*band player could ever testify for having seen it happen before. Yes, it
was a very special day, a very special day indeed, for it was -<br>
<br>
<b>THE DAY THE JELLY MOVED</b><br>
<br>
*Thunderclap*<br>
<br>
&lt;/dramatic voice&gt;<br>
<br>
Ok, sue me, I'm bored.<br>

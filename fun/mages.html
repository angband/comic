<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - Mages shall run away...</big><br>
<br>

&gt; Does anyone out there have any advice, or know of any faq's concerning 
mages? I cant seem to get one to last for any amount of time. I'm still kind of 
a newbie, but - geesh! they die so quickly.<br>
<br>

Most mages tend to die first few levels due to some error (trap, bad
luck, that sort of thing). Most characters do that, though. Just take it 
cautiously. If you heal fully (macro R&amp;\r is good) every possible chance and 
retreat so monsters don't chase you (closed doors often work, windy passages 
with U-turns work at times) to heal. Magic missile from afar, and don't use the 
dagger much. Stay near the stairs if you need to. The biggest thing is traps, 
which often are unavoidable. As a side, how about making traps take a percentage 
of hitpoints? It makes traps slightly less dangerous early on and much more 
dangerous later in the game. I usually spend more time getting my equipment from 
town than in the dungeon because of traps... Once you get them so they can cast 
MM with 4% fail and 20 or so mana, you should be able to take mages well. With 
trap detection macroed to avoid tedium of death and extra typing, you should be 
able to kill the harmful monsters before having to retreat. Run from orcs until 
you know you can take them. Run if you think it may be close. Be careful. Don't 
risk it so you go up the stairs with 3 hitpoints and then get beat up by a white 
mouse. Run away anyways. Rest often. Run away. Run away. By the way, run away! 
The key to mages is running away, in case you didn't know. This holds true once 
you get high enough to haste self... Run away. Phase door is a decent cameo too-
- Magic missile until they are adjacent... Phase door. Magic missile. Repeat. 
Often. Run away. Don't worry too much about Cold/Lightning/Fire bolts until you 
get them under 10% fail. Cast them to start, so you know how much mana you will 
need and whether you should run away. Keep phase door scrolls until you have 50 
mana or so. +STR items are valuble, as gnomes with 18/50 int will have at most 
10 STR.  +INT is also valuble. AC is not valuble if you are slowed-- Phase door 
will keep you away. Don't be afraid to run away. I don't normally use bows or 
slings, but if you find a nicely enchanted one feel free to use it. Buy a cheap 
generic one if you want to. Running away helps too. Also-- HitPoint warning at 
60% is my setting.. Run away before you hit that point, even. By the way, does 
anyone know if it is possible to set HP Warning to --More-- only with space? I 
get too close to death (or to it sometimes) by holding an arrow key while not 
paying attention... A space only --More-- for HP warnings would prolong my 
characters lives. I enjoy the any key --More--ing for orc pits at level 40 but 
the Ethereal dragons breathing unresisted light and confusion and such aren't 
fun to live through (Often because you don't). But I digress.<br>

Run away. Phase door. Run away. Magic Missile. Run away. R&amp;\r. Run away.<br>

<b>The compiler 'gcc'</b> [+20] (+4):<br>
It can be activated every turn for compiling.<br>
It affects your compiling speed.<br>
It is perfectly balanced for compiling.<br>
It provides resistance to Microso-, er, to Nether. :)<br>
It is especially deadly against software bugs.<br>
It fights against Microso- er, Evil, with holy wrath.<br>
It cannot be harmed by the elements, but your computer can.<br>

<b>Elvis, the King of Rock'n'Roll</b> ('p'/'p'):<br>
Your ancestors have killed at least 1 of these creatures... or have
they?  Sightings in remote fast-food restaurants are reported every
month or so, but he has many impersonators and a cult of adoring fans
who will not let the legend die.  Could it be that this man is sustained
in a sort of ghoulish half-existence by blood sacrifices of adventurers
such as yourself?  Don't be cruel!  He is normally found at depths of
1000 feet.  Killing this creature is worth 800.00 points for a 10th
level character.  He moves at normal speed.  He may breathe sound, about
1 time in 8.  He is magical, casting spells which summon help, confuse
("All Shook Up"), haste self ("Twist and Shout"), create fire balls
("Burnin' Love"), or cause insanity ("In The Ghetto").  He can hit to
attack, hit to attack, sing, and sing.<br>

<b>Veteran Angband player</b>:  It can attack to annoy, attack to annoy,
attack to gloat about latest victory post.  You feel an intense desire to
kill this creature...<br>

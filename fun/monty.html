Don't forget the Lumberjack, That lady who lures milkmen into her closet,
Lemming of the BDA, The Dr. Strangelove-type guy from the same skit as Lemming...
maybe the girls from Castle Anthrax..<br>

I suppose we would have to have various fresh fruits as weapons, as well as guns, tigers, and 500 ton weights<br>
<br>
Perhaps the "Wink wink nudge nudge" guy?<br>

Hmm... I didn't realize that there was so much roguelike material in the Monty Python stuff.  I may have to start my own variant,
CNTAngband, (Completely Non-Tolkienian Angband) which in due time will resemble KaMBand in it's dementedness.<br>
<br>
Instead of the normal dungeon system, (one or four main dungeons
with little side dungeons) I contemplate many specialized dungeons like The Tower of London, The Big University, The Real World and The Flying Circus. 
There would be no *main* level, just one huge, more realistic wilderness.  It would be much more possible to gain experience in a non-violent way.
 Also, perhaps I could put in real
occupations, not just the wide variety of occupations that involve
killing monsters:<br>
<br>
{Monster-Slayer of the Unabashed and Direct Variety;
Religion-Mocking Monster-Slayer;
Monster-Slayer who Has Mana and is Too Wimpy to stand next to his
victims;
Monster-Slayer who Has a Bow and Is Too wimpy To stand Next to his
Victims}<br>
<br>
I mean real occupations like lumberjacks, farmers, blacksmiths,
doctors, lawyers, and criminals and combinations of these,
(lawyer/criminals come to mind).<br>

Well, to avoid any unintended risque meanings--I'd vote for the name "NotBand" (since most of the standard creatures, items, races, etc. are NOT going to be
in it).<br>

How about SCDAngband (Something Completely Different) or even NFSCDAngband (you figure it out). You could even use the German version in the German episode they did,
UJFEGAAngband.<br>

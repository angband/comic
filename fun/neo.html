Someone has just *got* to include a "paranoid howler monkey" [PHM] as a
monster in a variant. It is similar to a "Shrieker mushroom patch" - it
hastes monsters but makes them run away from the area :)<br>
<br>
Consider using the following flags (from Z 270)<br>
<br>
F:FORCE_SLEEP | NEVER_MOVE | NEVER_BLOW |<br>
Some would say PHMs blow :)<br>
<br>
F:STUPID | EMPTY_MIND |<br>
<br>
Definitely<br>
<br>
F:IM_POIS | WILD_DUNGEON_01 | WILD_SWAMP1 | WILD_SWAMP2 | DROP_CORPSE |<br>
<br>
F:NO_CONF | NO_SLEEP | NO_FEAR<br>
<br>
PHM can't be confused because they are always right. They can claim they are
confused to avoid making an apology and changing the subject. They don't
sleep because they monitor the newsgroup 24 hours a day. They don't exhibit
fear because they are always right.<br>
<br>
S:1_IN_4 |<br>
<br>
S:SHRIEK<br>
<br>
Or should "SHRIEK" be changed to "HOWL" (instead of POST_FLAME)<br>
<br>

Hit to confuse. Hit to drain wisdom. Hit to poison (RGRA). Squeal to wake
monsters.<br>
<br>
"The Paranoid Howler Monkey is rarely seen but often heard. It has a thin
skin but astonishing endurance. It is extremely territorial."<br>

And definitely have fire breath. Or at least fire bolt.<br>

<br>

And they should resist fire (immune to fire perhaps?) because flames don't
affect them. Or could they reflect fire-bolt / fire-ball attacks?<br>
<br>
And maybe there could be a PHM unique - Kong, King of the Paranoid Howler
Monkeys.<br>
<br>

<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - OSAngband</big><br>
<br>

Of course, the day after I make the announcement post, I realize that OSAngband
(old school Angband) would have been a *much* better name. Grrrrrrrrrr.<br>

No, that has to be saved for "Operating System: Angband", where to
delete a file, you have to hunt it down and kill it. Where various
programs are invoked through your "spellbooks" and installing a new
piece of hardware requires successful use your "Device Skill". Sure,
it'll be a challenge to use, but isn't the challenge what we love
about Angband in the first place?<br>

Plus, every time you re-boot your computer it would randomly re-arrange the
whole file directory.<br>
<br>
I would still prefer it to Windows ME.<br>

<br>

Dunno about him, but for me, it's the fact that it looks like line noise, and 
its syntaxes (note the plural) are weird, twisted, and unpredictable. (at least 
to the uninitiated.)<br>
<br>
Gotta love a language where constructs like @{${$_[0]}{data}} are not something 
constructed by a sick, twisted mind, but was the first way I came up with to do 
something without a bunch of temp variables.  (OK, so that does make it the 
product of a sick, twisted mind, but I didn't mean to be evil.)<br>

Perl is not ONLY a horrendous syntactic abortion, it's also a design nightmare.<br>

Yes, a lot of people use Perl, Cobol, Basic, and other spawns of the
crawling chaos.  People do all kind of horrible things, but why should I?<br>

Some people, when confronted with a problem, think ``I know, I'll use
regular expressions.'' Now they have two problems.<br>

If we're on the subject of computer languages that Should Not Exist, it's hard to beat the <b>Intercal</b> manual for humor value.<br>

It is an impressive work.  I've seen strong men break down in tears
only a few chapters in.<br>

<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - It's a hard life being a potion</big><br> 
<br> 

<i>I dropped 5 potions of cure light wounds in my house, but when I tried to pick them up, it said that I didn't have
enough gold to buy them, from my own house?!</i><br>
<br>
It's a hard life being a potion, you know. You get stuck in a cramped back-pac with battlestained weapons and smelly
food. You get jostled around. I'm sure that when a potion finally gets a chance to relax and have some personal space,
it isn't very keen on going back to the backpack. It's reasonable to pay it something for it's troubles.<br>

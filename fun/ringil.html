<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - The Ringil Song</big><br>
<br>

<i>To the tune of Jingle Bells:</i><br>
<br>
Ringil bells<br>
Ringil bells<br>
Ringil all the way<br>
Oh what fun to hack<br>
and slash and kill<br>
and stab and slay, hey!<br>
<br>
Down at 50'<br>
My very first trip down<br>
I found a long sword (4d5)<br>
And hauled it back to town!<br>
<br>
I scummed 10 thousand turns<br>
an ID scroll to buy<br>
I killed a couple singing drunks<br>
I hardly even tried, oh!<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
<br>
I went a good bit deeper<br>
My heart and brain did soar<br>
I did not get much sleep, or<br>
eat or do my chores, for!<br>
<br>
I was having so much fun<br>
Stabbing orcs in the stomachs<br>
And killing Bert and Tom and Bill<br>
And Lokkah, dirty lummox! Oh!<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
<br>
Draebor did appear<br>
And brought along his friends<br>
I fought them hard, I really did!<br>
But the game I feared would end<br>
<br>
I looked up in the help files<br>
I looked there under 'A'<br>
I pressed Aa*t<br>
And blew those imps away! Hey!<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
<br>
I then began stat gain<br>
It was 'bout half past nine<br>
I finally met Wormtongue (at last!)<br>
And split his crooked spine<br>
<br>
The clock it did strike midnight<br>
The room was in a hush<br>
I fought an Ancient Multi-hued<br>
And beat it's brains to mush, oh!<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
<br>
This song is very long<br>
it really ought to end<br>
but before I do so I must say<br>
One thing more 'bout my friend<br>
<br>
We got down to Baphomet<br>
We got him down to three<br>
Then he breathed force (the sob)<br>
And sleep could come to me<br>
<br>
But Ringil it leapt up<br>
And hid itself anew<br>
And someday we will meet again<br>
And go give him his due, oh!<br>
<br>
(Chorus)<br>
<br>

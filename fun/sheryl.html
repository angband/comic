<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - to the tune of Sheryl Crow</big><br>
<br>

Hit it!<br>
This ain't no shooter<br>
It ain't no graphics game either<br>
This is Angband!<br>
<br>
"All I wanna do is get a little CON before I die,"<br>
Says the hobbit next to me out of nowhere<br>
It's apropos<br>
Of nothing<br>
He says his name's Peregrine but I'm sure,<br>
He's Pip or Pippin or Perry<br>
And he's underequipped to me<br>
And I wonder if he's ever had a potion of CON in his whole life<br>
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday<br>
In a bar that faces the Temple<br>
The adventurers of the world are enchanting their armor<br>
Between quests, reading and chanting<br>
As best they can in helms with visors<br>
<br>
They wear their shiny chain mails and shields<br>
Back to the dungeon, to get killed by Kavlax<br>
Well, they're nothing like Pippin and me, cause<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
All I wanna do is get some CON<br>
I got a feeling I'm not the only one<br>
All I wanna do is get some CON<br>
I got a feeling I'm not the only one<br>
All I wanna do is get some CON<br>
Until my hitpoints stop me from being killed by manastorms<br>
<br>
I like a Potion of Berserk Strength early in the morning<br>
And Pippin likes to brand his bolts<br>
Using Holy Infusions<br>
He recalls into the dungeon<br>
Then takes his bolts from his quiver<br>
Shooting each one at a vampire in the corner<br>
that's pointing and cursing at him<br>
And he's watching the Bolts of Flame as they spin in the air<br>
<br>
And a pair of dragons enters the room<br>
Dangerously close to one another<br>
Pippin takes them out with his crossbow<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
Otherwise the dungeon is ours,<br>
The pits and the vaults and the corridors too<br>
The bolts and the potions and the armors and helms<br>
The floor and the roof but<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>

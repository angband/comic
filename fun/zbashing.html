<big>Angbandish Fun (r.g.r.a highlights) - Z-bashing</big><br>
<br>

The problem isn't stupidity, it's egotism, the Z people forget that it's a variant and assume Z is the only version around.
See, I don't joke, I honestly think Zangband is an abomination. It violates every rule in the angband philosophy, except portability.
It's big, klunky, unstable, bug ridden, bad joke ridden, Bill Gates would be proud, except for the bad jokes.
Zangband makes a mockery of the idiom of vanilla and most variants. V, O, and Ey are carefully balanced, but Z has so many strange
racial powers and bizzare magical realsm that it is surely impossible to balance. There is beauty in simplicity, and the Zangband
crowd has forgotten this.<br>
